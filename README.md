## Project Goals and Design
### Goal 
Our goal with this project was to create a website for students at the University of Georgia to help each other find and rate textbooks for classes. At the beginning of each semester, students have to struggle to find where to buy or rent a textbook, and once that is done, sometimes it never even gets used. Professors can be ambiguous sometimes about whether it will be used or if everyone really needs it to pass the class. We wanted to remove that added stress at the beginning of the semester and instead centralize it such that students can help students.
### Design Ideas
One of our main sources of inspiration for this concept was the website RateMyProfessor. This site reviews professors and gives students some insight into a class before they register and choose which professor is best for them. Along with that, we also wanted to pull from the idea of centralizing a bunch of resources for studentsâ€”where to buy or rent, if it is a good textbook for the class, if the professor requires it, etc.
### Description
Our website is a complete one-stop for students trying to navigate textbooks for classes at the beginning of the semester. On our website, you can find reviews for a textbook and where to buy it or find a download. It allows students to have a stress-free beginning of the semester when it comes to textbooks. Reading through reviews to see if it is necessary, how helpful it is, the cost, where to find it, and adding it to your list are all available features for students on our site.
